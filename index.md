Welcome to my portfolio website, where you can explore my ongoing projects and read my written works.

# About Me

I graduated in the Class of 2024 from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. I am currently working as a researcher at Koi Investment Partners, specializing in AI and machine learning. In my spare time, I am a crypto quant trader.

# Dorje Algo

[Martin Ko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinkko/) (HKU E&F '24) and I have started a partnership business called "Dorje Algo". Our mission is to develop profitable trading strategies and algorithmic models for cryptocurrency.

By using blockchain and market datasets, we leverage mathematical techniques and machine learning algorithms to generate long and short signals on a range of top cryptocurrencies and derivatives.
